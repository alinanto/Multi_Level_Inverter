# NINE LEVEL INVERTER BASED ON SWITCHED CAPACITOR STRUCTURE

## DECLARATION

I hereby declare that the project report ( Nine Level Inverter based on
Switched Capacitor Structure), submitted for partial fulfillment of the requirements for
the award of degree of Bachelor of Technology of the APJ Abdul Kalam Technological
University, Kerala is a bonafide work done by me under supervision of T.G. SANISH KU-
MAR, Associate Professor, Government Engineering College, Thrissur. This submission
represents my ideas in my own words and where ideas or words of others have been in-
cluded; I have adequately and accurately cited and referenced the original sources. I
also declare that I have adhered to ethics of academic honesty and integrity and have
not misrepresented or fabricated any data or idea or fact or source in our submission. I
understand that any violation of the above will be a cause for disciplinary action by the
institute and/or the University and can also evoke penal action from the sources which
have thus not been properly cited or from whom proper permission has not been obtained.
This report has not been previously formed the basis for the award of any degree, diploma
or similar title of any other University.

## ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

During the course of my project work several persons collaborated directly and indi-
rectly with me. Without their support it would be impossible for me to finish my work.
That is why I wish to dedicate this section to recognize their support.
I want to start expressing my thanks to my project guide T.G Sanish Kumar,
Associate Professor Dept. of Electrical Engineering, because of his valuable advice and
guidance towards this work. I received motivation; encouragement and hold up from his
during the course of work.
I am thankful to Dr. Reji P, Head of the Department, and our Principal Dr
Sheeba V.S, for their sole co-operation.
I am grateful to express my thanks to all the faculty members of our department
for their support. I articulate my gratitude to all my associates and colleagues for their
support and help for this work.
Last, but not the least I wish to express my gratitude to God Almighty for His
abundant blessings without which this effort would not have been successful.

## ABSTRACT

Multilevel inverter is a power electronic device capable of providing desired output using
multiple lower level DC voltages as an input. Multilevel inverters are gaining popularity
over conventional two level inverters because it can produce a smoother stepped output
waveform. Moreover, the output obtained from multilevel inverters has lower dv=dt and
lower harmonic distortions. Multilevel inverters usually make use of diode clamped, 
flying capacitor or cascaded H-bridge topologies. These topologies suffer from disadvantages
such as multitude of components, large size and cost as well as complex control. This
project aims to use a switched-capacitance (SC) structure to overcome the disadvantages
of the existing topologies. It involves adding an SC structure to the H-bridge inverter
using capacitors, switches and diodes to create a multilevel DC voltage at the DC bus of
the H-bridge circuit. The proposed technology will improve upon the existing technology
by having boost operation without magnetic elements, fewer components, less complex
control and using only one power DC source. This project work involves the simulation
and hardware implementation of Nine level Inverter based on Switched Capacitance
Structure.
